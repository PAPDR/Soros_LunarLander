# LunarLander

***Soros_Lunar_Lander.ipynb***
Lunar Lander Map-Elites with Sliding Buffer code based on Professor Soros original code.
The code currently has a bug where when running the "runME" section causes the fixedFeatureMap to remove all of it's elites.


***Toy_LunarLander***
A very basic rough code made by Pedro which is supposed to run the model and create a heatmap based on it. The code is pretty rough and manual and not currently working with the simulation taken from Soros' Lunar Lander code.
