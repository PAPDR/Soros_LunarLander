# LunarLander

***OriginalLunarLander.py***

The original lunar lander code, unedited. Tested with Python 3.8.10, in a virtual environment with the requirements in `requirements.txt`. To install and activate a python virtual environment, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Once activated, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

***Changed_Lunar_Lander.ipynb***
Lunar Lander Map-Elites with Sliding Buffer code based on Professor Soros original code.
The code currently has a bug where when running the "runME" section causes the fixedFeatureMap to remove all of it's elites.

***Toy_LunarLander***
A very basic rough code made by Pedro which is supposed to run the model and create a heatmap based on it. The code is pretty rough and manual and not currently working with the simulation taken from Soros' Lunar Lander code.
